A comprehensive toolkit for testing and implementing accessibility features in React Native applications. AccessHub aims to help developers create more inclusive mobile applications by providing practical examples, testing tools, and implementation guidelines.

## 🎯 Purpose

AccessHub serves as both a learning resource and a testing ground for React Native accessibility features. It helps developers:
- Understand accessibility best practices
- Test components against WCAG guidelines
- Compare accessibility implementations across frameworks
- Learn about screen reader compatibility
- Implement accessible UI patterns

## 🚀 Features

- **Component Testing**: Test and verify accessibility features of common UI components
  - Text & Headers
  - Interactive Elements
  - Form Components
  - Complex Interactions

- **Screen Reader Support**
  - TalkBack (Android) implementation guides
  - VoiceOver (iOS) testing examples
  - Practical usage demonstrations

- **Framework Comparison**
  - Compare React Native and Flutter implementations
  - Best practices for each framework
  - Code examples and patterns

- **Documentation**
  - WCAG guidelines implementation
  - Mobile-specific accessibility considerations
  - Developer resources and references
