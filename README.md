## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version)
- Expo CLI
- For building: Windows with WSL or macOS

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gabrielrovesti/AccessibleHub.git
cd AccessibleHub/my-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npx expo start
```

---

## üì¶ Building for Android (Windows/WSL)

On this part, I will explain how to build the app for Android using Windows. I even made a video on the topic, which you can find on my personal YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q2l4QdDU9k&t=412s).

### 1. Set Up WSL Environment

```bash
# Install WSL (in PowerShell as Administrator)
wsl --install

# After restart, install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store
# Then set up development environment in WSL:

# Install essential tools
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk-headless

# Install Node.js via NVM
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install --lts

# Install Gradle
wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip -P /tmp
sudo mkdir /opt/gradle
sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle /tmp/gradle-8.5-bin.zip
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/android
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=${ANDROID_HOME}
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-8.5/bin:${ANDROID_HOME}/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools/bin
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Building the App

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Navigate to your project
cd /mnt/c/YourProjectPath

# Initialize EAS
eas init

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Create eas.json or modify to include:
# {
#   "build": {
#     "preview": {
#       "android": {
#         "buildType": "apk"
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }

# Build APK locally
eas build --platform android --profile preview --local
```

## üì± Building for iOS (macOS) 

This was made adapting from what I saw from Salvatore Gatto, Mirko Franco and prof. Ombretta Gaggi. Thanks to them it was installed, otherwise it would not have been possible to test the app on iOS devices.

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode 14+ installed
- Apple Developer Account (paid membership required for device testing)
- Node.js (LTS version)
- Expo CLI and EAS CLI installed

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Install required tools
npm install -g @expo/cli eas-cli

# Navigate to your project
cd my-app

# Ensure dependencies are up to date
npm update
npm install

# Install development client for device testing
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

### 2. Development Build for iOS Devices

#### A. Device Registration
First, register your iOS device(s) for development:

```bash
# Register device via web interface
eas device:create

# Or register multiple devices using the generated URL
# Share the registration link with team members
```

#### B. Build Configuration
Ensure your `eas.json` includes development profile:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {
      "autoIncrement": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### C. Create Development Build

```bash
# Build for device testing
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Alternative: Build locally (requires Xcode setup)
npx expo run:ios --device
```

### 3. Certificate Management & Team Organization Issues

#### Apple Developer Account Setup
When running EAS build for the first time, you'll be prompted to:
1. **Log in to Apple Developer Account**: Use your Apple ID credentials
2. **Select Team**: Choose your development team (individual or organization)
3. **Generate Certificates**: Allow EAS to handle distribution certificates and provisioning profiles

#### The MobileLab/UniPD Solution - Team Member Workflow

**Understanding the Problem:**
The issue encountered was related to being added as a team member to an organizational Apple Developer account (MobileLab) rather than having a personal paid account. This creates specific certificate limitations and workflow requirements.

**Key Technical Details:**
- **Personal Apple ID + Organization Team**: When you're added to an organization team, you use your personal Apple ID but inherit the team's certificate authority
- **7-Day Certificate Limitation**: This is NOT a limitation of the paid Apple Developer Program, but occurs when using "Personal Team" in Xcode without proper team membership
- **VPN Group Access**: The solution involved adding the developer to the proper VPN group for institutional network access

**The Working Solution (Salvatore Gatto's Method):**

1. **Team Member Addition**: 
   - Account holder (MobileLab) added developer to organization team
   - Developer received email invitation to join team
   - Used personal Apple ID to accept invitation

2. **Certificate Generation**:
   ```bash
   # Once added to team, create new 1-week development certificate
   # This was NOT a limitation but a choice for security
   # Normal certificates last 1 year, but shorter ones can be generated
   ```

3. **VPN Configuration**:
   - Connected to institutional VPN
   - Added to proper development group permissions
   - This resolved network authentication issues

4. **Workflow Implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Both command line and Xcode worked seamlessly
   npm update
   npm install
   npx expo run:ios --device  # Command line method
   # AND/OR open in Xcode for GUI development
   ```

#### Common Certificate Problems & Solutions

**Problem 1: "You are not allowed to perform this operation" (Team Permission Issue)**
```bash
# Solution: Contact team admin to verify your role
# Ensure you have "Developer" role with certificate access
# Check in Apple Developer Portal > People & Access
```

**Problem 2: "Certificate for this server is invalid" or Certificate Mismatch**
```bash
# Clear existing credentials and regenerate
eas credentials -p ios
# Select "Delete all credentials" and rebuild
```

**Problem 3: "Maximum number of certificates reached"**
- Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/)
- Delete expired or unused certificates
- Regenerate with `eas build --platform ios --clear-cache`

**Problem 4: University/Organization Account Issues**
For institutional accounts (like UniPD):

```bash
# The working solution involved:
# 1. Being properly added to the organization team
# 2. Using VPN for institutional network access
# 3. Certificate generation through team account (not personal)
# 4. Both CLI and Xcode methods work identically
```

**Problem 5: 7-Day Certificate Expiration (Personal Team vs Organization Team)**
- **Personal Team (Free)**: Limited to 7-day certificates, 3 devices, 10 App IDs
- **Organization Team Member**: Full 1-year certificates, unlimited devices
- **Solution**: Ensure proper team membership, not using "Personal Team" in Xcode

### 4. Local Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development server
npx expo start

# For device testing with installed development build
npx expo start --dev-client

# Install on connected device
npx expo run:ios --device
```

### 5. Testing on Physical Devices

#### Method 1: EAS Build + QR Code Installation
1. Build with `eas build --platform ios --profile development`
2. Scan QR code from build completion page
3. Install via iOS Settings ‚Üí VPN & Device Management ‚Üí Trust Developer

#### Method 2: Direct USB Installation
```bash
# Connect device via USB
npx expo run:ios --device

# Select your device from the list
# App will install and launch automatically
```

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear all caches and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json ios/
npm install
eas build --platform ios --clear-cache
```

#### Xcode Integration Issues
```bash
# Ensure Xcode command line tools are installed
xcode-select --install

# Accept Xcode license
sudo xcodebuild -license accept

# Open iOS project in Xcode for debugging
npx expo run:ios --no-bundler
open ios/YourApp.xcworkspace
```

#### Device Installation Problems
- **Enable Developer Mode**: iOS Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Developer Mode
- **Trust Certificate**: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management ‚Üí Trust App
- **Clear App Cache**: Delete app and reinstall

### 7. Production Build

```bash
# Build for App Store submission
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Submit to App Store
eas submit --platform ios
```

### 8. Testing Environment Setup

#### Test Devices Used (MobileLab Configuration)
- **iPhone XR** (iOS 16+) - mobilelabunipd@gmail.com
- **iPhone 14** (iOS 17+) - mobilelabunipd@gmail.com  
- **iPhone X** (iOS 15+) - MobileLab lending library

#### Institutional Testing Notes (UniPD/MobileLab Experience)
**Successful Configuration Details:**
- **Team Organization**: Developers added to MobileLab organization team
- **Certificate Management**: 1-week development certificates (security policy, not limitation)
- **VPN Integration**: Institutional VPN access with development group permissions
- **Testing Method**: Both `npx expo run:ios --device` and Xcode GUI methods work seamlessly
- **iOS Version Compatibility**: No specific iOS version restrictions encountered
- **Account Setup**: Used mobilelabunipd@gmail.com for device registration and testing

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Proper Team Membership**: Added to organization team, not using personal certificates
2. **VPN Group Access**: Developer was added to appropriate VPN development group
3. **Certificate Workflow**: Organization-managed certificates (1-week validity by choice)
4. **Universal Compatibility**: Method works across different iOS versions and devices

### 9. Emergency Troubleshooting

```bash
# Complete project reset
rm -rf node_modules ios/ .expo/
npm install
npx expo prebuild --clean
eas build --platform ios --clear-cache
```

### 10. Useful Commands Reference

```bash
# Device management
eas device:create              # Register new device
eas device:list               # List registered devices
eas device:delete             # Remove device

# Certificate management
eas credentials -p ios        # Manage iOS credentials
